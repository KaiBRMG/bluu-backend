/**
 * Desktop app update config — the single gate for **every** Electron update
 * prompt, on both platforms. If this file doesn't target a platform, users on
 * that platform are never prompted, full stop. Nothing else decides.
 *
 * ▸ **Per-platform.** A release rarely matters to both OSes equally: v0.8.0 is
 *   what gives macOS auto-update, and is irrelevant to Windows. Set that
 *   platform to `null` and those users are left alone rather than nagged about
 *   a build that does nothing for them.
 *
 * ▸ **`null` means "no update targeted"** — no banner, no dialog, nothing. This
 *   is the default state between releases. It does NOT mean "optional".
 *
 * ▸ macOS is still gated by this file even though it can auto-update: a GitHub
 *   release alone never prompts anyone. `mac.latestVersion` decides who gets
 *   asked; the running app finds the actual artifact via `electron-updater`.
 *
 * ▸ **Delivery differs, policy doesn't.** `compulsory` and `latestVersion` mean
 *   the same thing on both platforms; only the button differs — macOS (v0.8.0+)
 *   downloads and installs in-app with a progress bar, Windows opens
 *   `downloadUrl` for a manual reinstall. A pre-0.8.0 mac build has no updater,
 *   so it falls back to `downloadUrl` too — `UpdateAvailableBanner` picks the
 *   delivery by feature-detecting the native updater, not by platform.
 *
 * ▸ **Only bump `latestVersion` AFTER the release artifacts are live** (and, for
 *   Windows, after `downloadUrl` actually serves the new installer). Deploying a
 *   `compulsory` bump early blocks users on a build they cannot obtain.
 *
 * ▸ `compulsory: true`  → blocking dialog; the user can't use the app until they
 *   update. `false` → dismissible card. Either way it is **start-up only** and
 *   never shown to a user who is clocked in — see `UpdateAvailableBanner`.
 *   On Windows prefer `false` for routine releases: updating means quitting and
 *   reinstalling by hand.
